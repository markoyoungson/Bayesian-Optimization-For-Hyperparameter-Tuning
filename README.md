# Bayesian-Optimization-For-Hyperparameter-Tuning
Using GPyTorch and BoTorch For Learning Rate Optimization For RL



Hey everyone, here I am showing my code that is used for optimizing hyper-parameters in rl OpenAi environments.

## General info
The code is broken down into three differenet folders, Gettingdata, which is where you choose which rl algorithmn and open ai envrionement you want to use. Fitting GP, where you can use the data gathered in the other folder to have a good visualization of the gaussian process fit to your data. And then Botorch, where you combine everything and do bayesian optimization
